    <h1>Shower Shoe Lords</h1>
    <h2>By Westside Gunn Ft. Benny The Butcher</h2>
    <div class="sample">
        <p>"His spirit moving<br>
        His presence ever near<br>
        That's how I know he's real<br>
        In my heart I feel<br>
        That's how I know that God is real<br>
        Yeah, what's more, you—"</p>
    </div>
    <div class="DJ-premier">
        <p>Ayo, I never gave a fuck—never will<br>
        "See, I can see the sound of my glow—"<br>
        "Rhyme nice—"</p>
    </div>
    <div class="westside-gunn-chorus">
        <p>Ayo, I never gave a fuck—never will<br>
        Hit him 18 times, he did the windmill (B'rrrrrrt!)<br>
        My man wrote me, said he heard I'm out here killin' shit<br>
        I put a grand on his books (FLYGOD)</p>
    </div>
    <div class="westside-gunn-verse">
        <p>Ayo, Madonna sucking Basquiat dick up in the spot<br>
        Hundred round drums, fuck around and get chopped<br>
        <i>Starin' at the turquoise Marilyn</i><br>
        Told my little man bag 20s, how imperative<br>
        40 in the jawn undercovers, the 'caine doin' numbers<br>
        Lose my work whippin', I'll leave your brains in the oven<br>
        Splash paint on my Christopher Kane jumper<br>
        Crash the Mulsanne, I copped the plane last summer<br>
        <i>The watch plain Jane, but it still cost 60</i><br>
        Ran up in the spot, stole base, Ken Griffey<br>
        Blood-stained Persians, wide body's got curtains<br>
        TEC just jammed, I just left it, shit worthless<br>
        <i>In the law library, tryin' to get time off<br>
        Prayin' five times a day, tryin' to get five off</i><br>
        Crush Doritos on this wheat rice and turkey, lord<br>
        <i>I wore my boots to the shower, razor tucked in my jaw</i></p>

    <div class="westside-gunn-chorus">
        <p>Ayo, I never gave a fuck—never will<br>

        <p><i>Uh, could've told my story on Oprah, 60 Minutes<br>
        How I earned plenty digits from risky business</i><br>
        What you know about a stint? Gotta sit for Christmas<br>
        Wifey on shit, that bitch missing visits<br>
        'Cause we was stretching white like Richard Simmons<br>
        Caught a case and I pled the 5th amendment<br>
        Yeah, you know the whip be rented and bricks be in it, uh<br>
        And I'ma get this chicken 'til my clique get sentenced<br>
        I need a stash in the wall that whole 90 pies<br>
        Word to me, I've been live since '95<br>
        Took a trip to get the bag like 90 times<br>
        Yeah, you got it from your plug, but it's probably mines<br>
        All I needed was a trap spot, scale and a plate<br>
        I ended up on a flat cot, cell upstate<br>
        Now I really need a black Glock, shells and a tank<br>
        Yeah, the shit'll get uglier than Welven Da Great<br>
        D's kicked in the door and snatched the full pound<br>
        <i>My man paid ten stacks just to blow trial<br>
        Now he callin' home, tellin' the crew to slow down<br>
        I'd be rich if I knew then what I know now, uh<br>
        Livin with regrets and I'm still willing to bear it<br>
        Plus the shoe fits and I'm still willing to wear it<br>
        It's hard being a family man with interference<br>
        All the women and them trips to prison ended my marriage<br>
        I grew up with a few damn crooks that bake work up<br>
        Who used to have food stamp books and case workers<br>
        Me? I'm way further from a place you ain't heard of<br>
        Where you get rich, die trying and face murder<br>
        Where your best friends start to switch when the case surface<br>
        Where it's hard to trust a man who ain't nervous<br>
        I fell asleep with 50 grand in a locked apartment<br>
        That night, I had a dream like Dr. Martin, woo, yeah</i></p>
